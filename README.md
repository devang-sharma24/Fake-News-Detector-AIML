# Fake News Detector (AIML Project)

## 📌 Overview
This project is an AI/ML-based Fake News Detection system that classifies news articles as **FAKE** or **REAL** using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques.

It is developed as part of an AIML internship project.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NLP (NLTK)
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Logistic Regression
- Streamlit (for web app)

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Fake and Real News Dataset (Kaggle)
- Files used:
  - Fake.csv
  - True.csv
- Dataset is **not uploaded to GitHub** due to size limits.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. Data collection and merging
2. Text preprocessing (cleaning, stopword removal)
3. Feature extraction using TF-IDF
4. Model training using Logistic Regression
5. Model evaluation
6. Web application using Streamlit
